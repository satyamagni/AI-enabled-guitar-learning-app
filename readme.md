CNote: play, compete & learn guitar
============================

## Problem Statement
Build an AI enabled guitar learning application
	Guitar is arguably the most popular and many times the first music instrument a person picks up in his/her music journey. Majority of such enthusiasts are unaware of the daunting task and the challenges they will be facing in this “unending¬” journey. The initial phase of this journey from picking up your first guitar to reaching an intermediate level is riddled with following problems:
  
* Monotonous practice leading to decrease in motivation over time
* Skipping foundational guitar techniques to learn your favorite songs (instant gratification) 
* Frustration due to no measure of progress
* Skipping music foundations like music theory, sight reading and ear training entirely

Although many mobile/web applications are currently in the market for self-learning guitar and addressing solutions to some of the above mentioned problems, most applications are not engaging users to keep up with the practice. Instead, many of these applications propagate the idea of learning popular songs to capture only one segment of the users, the so called ‘camp-fire’ guitarists. Users with different end goals such as learning ‘beginner’, ‘intermediate’ and ‘advanced’ skills to become a professional guitarist are not captured effectively, currently. The vision of C-Note application is to target all 4 segment of users (beginner, camp-fire, intermediate and advanced), but in a more engaging fashion than its predecessor apps. Development of new game-like features allowing engagement with your friends and other app users will help in building a healthy and interesting learning environment. A list of new features that can be developed for this purpose are listed below:

*	Sight reading battle :
    *	In music industry, sight reading refers to reading notes from a sheet of music It is an important skill to master and having a go-to app for some sight reading practice and challenging your peers could possibly enhance user learning
* Ear training battle :
    *	Ear training refers to the ability of identifying music notes by hearing them
    *	Opportunity to leverage ML/AI techniques for user specific practice questions based on past questions
*	Play scores and earn rewards : 
    *	In music terminology, a score refers to a piece of sheet music
    *	Leaderboard and point system for playing practice scores available on C-Note
    *	ML/AI could be leveraged to aid practice

*	Replayability and uploading new scores :
    *	Ability to upload scores that you wish to practice and listening to the melody is key in learning a piece of music
    *	Replayability of pdf sheets of music comes under a larger field of research known as optical music recognition. Although, the state of the art solution even today is not 100% accurate for every score available, commercial applications like ‘PlayScore2’ and ‘ScanScore’ do a good job at this task and generally claim an accuracy of more than 99%
